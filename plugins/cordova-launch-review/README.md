# Overview

This Cordova/Phonegap plugin for iOS and Android launches the native store app in order for the user to leave a review.

- On Android, the plugin opens the the app's storepage in the Play Store where the user can leave a review by pressing the stars to give a rating.
- On iOS, the plugin opens the app's storepage in the App Store and automatically opens the dialog for the user to leave a rating or review.
- On iOS 10.3 and above, the plugin supports the [native in-app rating dialog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/2851536-requestreview) which allows a user to rate your app without needing to open the App Store.

The plugin is registered on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-launch-review) (requires Cordova CLI 5.0.0+) as `cordova-launch-review`
